# Visualizing-Recursive-Trees

This project is to help visualize recursion by tracking recursive calls using a stack trace. Recursion could be a difficult concept to grasp and therefore this tool is meant to help those picture the tree. 

To run this: 

install Flask, graphviz

export FLASK_APP= application.py
export FLASK_ENV = development 

flask run
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 #to host from your IP address
